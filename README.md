# Railstone
Railstone is a minecraft mod.
I've always found rails a bit useless for transport when you get an elytra or build a nether highway.

So i tried to fix that with this mod by making it possible to teleport to the end of a rail from a station block. 

Warning: this is my first mod and is more of a quick prototype, so it's far from bug free and optimized.
